- Remove the debug statement that print out "generate classes for mobile", etc...
- Correct the gridle parameter conversion when there's only 1 parameter that need to be passed to a mixin

- Improve clear-each classes to target grid element even if others elements are injected in the html between grids (thanks Robert Krieg)

## 2.0.43

## 2.0.41

- There's now a LICENSE.txt file in the repo.

## 2.0.2

## 2.0.0

- To handle the nested grids, previous version had a parent class. This is no more needed.
- The new row class is at some point a replacement for the parent one. This class has to wrap each "lines" of columns. You will have more control over your columns alignement, etc...
- The grid-... classes has now became gr-... . It's 2 letters I know but this mean a lot in a large project...
- Now all of the grid classes stay in the same format. To scope a class in a particular state, just add @{stateName} at the end of your classname.
- The all new gr-grow and gr-adapt classes allows you to create columns that will behave dpending of the column content instead of a specific width.
- The all new row-align-... classes allows you to align your columns as you want (top, middle, bottom, left, center, right).
- Gridle has now a full flex version. To use this version, check out the driver section on the documentation. Some features are only available in a specific driver
- Gridle has now multiple drivers that you can use to generate your grid. For now the default and the flex driver are available. Some features are only available in a specific driver (cf. documentation).
